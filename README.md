# Aquadine
A basic application where you can order food. 

## Background
This project was originally for my internship, but it didn't work out the way I wanted. It was full of code smells, no unit tests and a bad infrastructe.
And so I restarted this project to learn about my mistakes and implement new features.

And also many thanks to Hugo for helping me with the initial structure!

## Used concepts
The project uses the following concepts:
- Clean architecture
- CQRS
- The mediator pattern
- Unit of Work
- Entity framework core
- .NET core 3.1

The following conepts are planned to be used:
- Azure (for deployment and Azure search)
